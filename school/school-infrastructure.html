                      Getting the little brains interested and engaged for future smart machines, ATAL TINKERING LABS are set up in certain number of schools in India by Central Government and NITI AYOG. Fortunately, we are one of those schools to have such a modern and techno-friendly set up here. The machine learning and artificial intelligence are the basic experiences our students get while tinkering in this lab. It is a lot similar to the DIY method. Basically the innovative ideas and skills are shaped here technically.
